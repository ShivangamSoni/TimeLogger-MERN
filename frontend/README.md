# React Starter Template

We can create a starter React Template using:

```bash
$ npx create-react-app <app-name-location>
```

But the problem with above is that it comes with a lot of Broiler-Plate Code.

So, this Brach Contains the Absolute Basic React Template Without most of the Broiler Plate.
